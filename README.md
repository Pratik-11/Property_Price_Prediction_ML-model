## Overview

The Property Price Prediction model is developed using advanced machine learning techniques to provide accurate predictions of property prices. It takes into account various features such as location, size, amenities, and more to estimate the property value.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
- **Model Training:** Train a machine learning model on the processed data to predict property prices.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics and techniques.
- **Prediction:** Use the trained model to make predictions on new property listings.

## Installation
